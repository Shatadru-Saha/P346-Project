# P346-Project
This work is done as a part of the course P346 instructed by Dr. Colin Benjamin at NISER, Bhubaneswar. In here attached is the solution for the three questions asked in the project. The Problems 8.8 and 8.9 first explores the Metropolis and Wolff Algorithms for simulating the Ising Model. We first observe the critical slowing down present in the Metropolis Algorithm then we show how we can get rid of it effectively with the Wolff Algorithm. Further we have  shown how the Metorpolis is almost as efficient as Wolff in high and low temperature conditions and we've explained why. The Problem 8.10 is completely on Stochastic Cells, primarily a single dimerisation reaction. In this question we first show the analytic equilibrium values the concentrations should take, then we show the same using numerical solving of the ODEs governing the system. Later we use stochastic methods to simulate the system and show where the two methods differ and where they converge to the same solutions.
